When you already have installed needed both dependencies that we say about, there are two ways to
compile and run this project.

### 1st way - with npm:

There is no need to install any dependencies.
If you have installed npm, just go to root folder of this project and run:

`npm run index`
 
### 2nd way - without npm:

Go to root folder of this project and run:

compile ts to js -> `tsc --build`  

run program -> `node index.js`
