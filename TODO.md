1. Print date before every message from sebastian and natalia without adding new .say(...) or console.xxx(...) and also
   append tab (tabulator) to the start of original message. You can't modify the classes Man/Woman/Person/Tongue
   <br/>Expected output:
   > 4:13:02 PM\
   > Person tongue says:     Hello my name is Sebastian\
   > 4:13:02 PM\
   > Person tongue says:     Hello my name is Natalia\
   > 4:13:02 PM\
   > Person tongue says:     Are you free?\
   > 4:13:02 PM\
   > Person tongue says:     No I have a boyfriend\

1. Create a function which will return PersonDelegate. This function should contain all delegates which are available.
   Use log delegate for filling the Array<string> (which you can create in this file, for logging everything which will
   income from delegate). Apply delegates for both persons, for future work with logs.
1. Change the classes for opportunity to specify name of created person. We wanna see name of person on conversation
   messages. <br/> Expected output:
   > 4:13:02 PM \
   > Sebastian's tongue says:     Hello my name is Sebastian
